Yes, you absolutely need to commit these changes and push them to GitHub. Vercel deploys the *latest version* of your code from your GitHub repository.

Here are the commands to commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add NavItem interface and example dropdown to Header1 component"
git push origin main
```

After pushing, you can then try to deploy to Vercel.
